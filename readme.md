# EESD Stone Masonry Database Dashboard
{@Patrick - please provide short project description. Images are welcome.}
The paper Vanin et al. (2017) "Estimates for the stiffness, strength and drift capacity of stone masonry walls based on 123 quasi-static cyclic tests reported in the literature" contains a database of quasi-static cyclic tests on stone masonry walls. This database is maintained and updated as new test results become available. This web application allows to display graphs, which show the important parameters and their distribution within the database for the updated versions of the database. These plots reproduce subplots of Figure 4 in the paper.


## Project status
The dashboard is under active development. A first version will be available by Dec 2021.

* Prototype v.1 runnnig at [eesd-stone-masonry.herokuapp.com/](https://eesd-stone-masonry.herokuapp.com/)
